# InterpoaltionProgram

Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within range of discrete set of known data points. The number of data points obtained by sampling or experimentation represents
The main task of Interpolation is to find suitable mathematical expression for known curve. This technique is used when we have to draw curve by determining intermediate points between known sample points.
